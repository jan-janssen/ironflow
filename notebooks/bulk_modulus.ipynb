    "# Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start up the GUI\n",
    "2. Select `MaterialProperty` from the `pyiron_atomistics` node list and add it to the graph.\n",
    "3. Click on the new node to open its node controller, and select `Bulk_modulus` from the `property` drop-down menu.\n",
    "   - Observe: This should change the `property` port-status to green.\n",
    "4. Click on the node-selector dropdown menu and change it from `atomistics_nodes` to `recommended`\n",
    "5. Click on the red `source` port on the `MaterialProperty` node\n",
    "   - Obeserve: The list of recommended ports is now populated by a node that has appropriate output for this port!\n",
    "6. Double-click to place the recommended node on the graph.\n",
    "7. Click on the `MaterialProperty` node `source` input port again.\n",
    "   - Observe: The corresponding port on `CalcMurnaghan` that has ontologically-valid output is highlighted white!\n",
    "8. Connect `source` to the highlighted `eq_bulk_modulus` port.\n",
    "   - Observe: The port status is still red. This connection is permissible by the ports' respective data types, and recommended by their respective ontological types, but our `CalcMurnaghan` node still has not been run, so the actual _values_ of these ports are still bad, hence the red color-coding.\n",
    "9. Starting with the `engine` input for `CalcMurnaghan`, follow the same process again:\n",
    "   1. Click the port to populate the recommended node list\n",
    "   2. Place a recommended node\n",
    "   3. Click the port to highlight where on the newly place node you should connect it to.\n",
    "   - Repeat this for engine &rarr; Lammps&rarr;engine; structure&rarr;BulkStructure&rarr;structure\n",
    "   - Observe: Without knowing a-priori which nodes we need to use, we simply follow recommendations to populate our graph\n",
    "10. We're still missing one piece of input: a `Project`. This isn't ontologically typed (yet!) so just go back to the `atomistics_nodes` menu and add a `Project` node and connect it to the two open `project` input values.\n",
    "11. Run the `CalcMurnaghan` job\n",
    "   - Observe: If you use `SHOW` to investigate the `CalcMurnaghan` and `MaterialProperty` node outputs, you'll see that the bulk modulus gets converted from the Murnaghan units of GPa to the ontology's units of MPa.\n",
    "12. Select `MaterialProperty` again, and choose `B_prime` from the `property` dropdown.\n",
    "   - Observe: The `eq_bulk_modulus` output of `CalcMurnaghan` still has a green (valid) output port, but the `source` input port of `MaterialProperty` is now red (invalid) -- this is because the provided ontological type no longer matches the requested property.\n",
    "13. Click on the `source` input port again; disconnect it from `eq_bulk_modulus` and reconnect it to the recommended port."

Of course Lammps can take almost any type of atomic structure; the requirement that the input here be bulk-like was passed down through the graph from the Murnaghan node. So while this particular example is simple, I hope this demonstrates the power of ontologically guided workflow design."
