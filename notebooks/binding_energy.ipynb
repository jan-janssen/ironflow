This is possible, but note that the decoration pattern is defined by the `InputArray` node used to define the `indices` for species change -- if you make any changes to the GB in question, you'll need to examine it (click `SHOW` and look at the `plot3d`) and choose new indices for your desired decoration pattern (clicking on individual atoms in the NGLView presentation of the structure shows their index, sometimes with a `^` character breaking up the number, i.e. `4^2` is `42`).\n",

To accomplish this, we just manually select a potential from the `LammpsPotentials` node after giving it one of the _solute containing_ structures."
