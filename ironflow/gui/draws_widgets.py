ipywidgets holds each instantiated widget independently, and they aren't released to the
garbage collector until their `close` method has been called and there are no further
references to their isntance.

If we're not careful, this can lead to a massive bloat of the registered widgets and
memory strain. Here, we introduce a abstract class to help manage the closure of the
widgets we create.

    A mixin for classes that instantiate ipywidgets widgets to make sure they get
    cleaned up ok.

    Looks at the total number of widgets added to the widget registry at instantiation
    and stores them. Similarly, when `draw` is called, all the new widgets are stored.
    Then at `close` and `clear`, all or just the drawn widgets (respectively) are closed
    and deleted.

    The `__del__` method ensures that `close` gets called before the object is garbage
    collected.

    As long as all new widget instantiate happens inside `__init__` or `_draw` methods,
    they are automatically registered without any effort by the child class.
